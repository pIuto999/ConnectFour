In order to play this game you need to have python 3.7(or higher) installed and run the code.
The mechanics are really simple you can navigate to where you want to place your piece using your mouse.
You play against an AI(bot) that is smart and tries to predict your moves.
The bot's difficulty is really hard so dont get grumpy if you lose:)
